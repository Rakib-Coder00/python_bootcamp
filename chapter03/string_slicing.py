name = "Python"
# greeting = "Hello,"
# print(type(name))

# Concatenating two strings:
# print(greeting + " " + name)

print(name[0])
print(name[1])
print(name[-1])

# name[2] = "X" # This will give error

# String Slicing:
print(name[0:3]) # This will print "Pyt"
print(name[:3]) # This will start from the beginning and print "Pyt"
print(name[3:]) # This will print from 3rd index to end
print(name[-3:]) # This will print from last 3rd index to end
