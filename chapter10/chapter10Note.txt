 ***  Object oriented Programming***

 Solving a problem by creating object is on of the most popular approaches in programming. This is called Object Oriented Programming.

 **Class :

 A class is a blueprint for an object. A class can contain data and functions.


 **Object :
    An object is an instance of a class. An object is a real life entity.When class is defined, a template(info) is defined. Memory is allocated only after object instantiation.

    Object of a given class can be invoke the methods available to it without revealing the implementation details to the user.


** Modeling  a problem in OOP:


** Class Attribute:
An Attribute that belongs to the class rather than a particular object.

** Instance Attribute:
An Attribute that belongs to the instance(object).

** self parameter:
self is a reference to the current instance of the class.
it's automatically passed with a function call from an object.


** Static method:
sometimes we need to use the same method for multiple objects.


** Constructor:
A special method that is called when an object is created.
