** Variable:
A variable is the name given to a memory location in a program that can be used to store data.


** Data Types:
Data types are the types of data that can be stored in a variable.

1.Integers: Integers are whole numbers.
2.Floating point numbers : Floating point numbers are numbers with a decimal point.
3.Strings: A string is a sequence of characters. A string is enclosed in quotes. For example, "Hello World".
4.Booleans: A boolean is either true or false. For example, true or false.
5.None: None is a special value that is used to indicate that a variable has no value.


** Python is a fantastic language that automatically identifies the type of data for us.

a = 71   -> Identifies a as <class 'int'>
b = 3.14 -> Identifies b as <class 'float'>
c = "Hello" -> Identifies c as <class 'str'>


** Rules for defining a variable name ->
-- A variable name can contain letters, numbers, and underscores. It cannot start with a number.
-- A variable name can only start with a letter or an underscore.
-- A variable name cannot be a reserved word.
-- A variable name cannot be the same as another variable name.
-- white space is not allowed in the variable name.
-- A variable is a case sensitive.


[** Python is a dynamically typed language.
** Python is a strongly typed language.]

** Operators in Python:
1. Arithmetic Operators:
    + Addition
    - Subtraction
    * Multiplication
    / Division
    % Modulus ETC.
2. Comparison Operators:
    == Equal to
    != Not equal to
    > Greater than
    < Less than
    >= Greater than or equal to
    <= Less than or equal to
3. Logical Operators:  and, or, not
4. Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *= etc
